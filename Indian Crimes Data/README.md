# 🕵️‍♂️ Crime Trends in Indian Cities – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

A Python-based Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project focused on uncovering crime trends across various Indian cities. Using structured crime report data, the project identifies behavioral patterns related to time of day, victim profiles, weapon usage, and regional distribution. The insights are valuable for law enforcement, public safety planning, and awareness campaigns.
